    <p>
      Featured in a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/03/seattle-band-map/">Wired.com article</a>, Seattle Band Map is an experimental map of local bands. Powered
      by GraphViz,
      the user-submitted bands connect to each other if they have played together or have shared a band member.
      The result is a sprawling spiderweb of the Seattle music scene.

      The Stanford Symphony Orchestra website is where fans and members of the symphony to get the latest
      news on the group. I did a visual redesign and migrated them to Wordpress to make it easily editable. We timed the release of the new look with the debut of Stanford campus's new Bing Concert Hall in January 2013.

      <a href="https://twitter.com/minigolf2000/status/1403020118586662917">GIF from Twitter</a>. Race to the finish vs. up to 100 people on your own custom race courses w/ my
      Figma Maker Week Plugin, 100 Race!
      This is a simple plugin that takes in user input and does some simple platforming calculations to move a node around. The viewport then follows that node. The
      magic lies in Figma's multiplayer, which lets up to 100 users run this plugin
      simultaneously to edit nodes on the same page.

      A Figma Plugin to play and make Zelda worlds. Create worlds right in Figma, then run this Plugin to play them! Figma is a collaborative interface design tool, and I think level design for games is another type of design that benefits greatly from collaboration.

    <p>
      Part of a suite of web tools I made as a contractor for Winsome, Stock Locator takes existing textual ERP data and displays it
      as an easy-to-read map. Warehouse pickers can use their iPads to quickly inspect locations, search for items, or see which locations are low on
      quantity. This data used to be accessed through a text based DB query program at a computer terminal. These web tools
      help make information more readily accessible, improving warehouse efficiency and ultimately increasing # average items processed daily.
